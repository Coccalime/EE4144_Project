  //Function that returns a floating point distance value from IR sensor. 
 

  //Function that returns position of ball from the photodiodes (pre-measured values from a ruler). Accomplished by determining which diode is currently activated. i.e. The one that is 5cm to the left of the center. 
  //Recomend to use polling instead of interupts to check all 10 sensors. 
  

  //Function that controls the position of the servo motor.
